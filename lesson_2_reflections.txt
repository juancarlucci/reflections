1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    Starting a new repository  “git init”. To check content, “ls -a”.
    A new file .git is created in the directory where the git init was made.
    This .git file contains the metadata for the repository. No commits are yet created
    since it is brand new. If you run a "git log" when there are no commits will
    get error “fatal: bad default revision ‘HEAD’”. Meaning, no commits yet.

2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

    It is the area that holds the changes before you commit them to the working directory.
